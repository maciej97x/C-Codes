int integer - number, height, width
char characters - letter
float - sqrt2, pi
&& - and
|| - or
! - not
== equal
!= not equal
while (true) - loop forever
ctrl+c finish a forever loop, infinite loop
for (int i = 0; i < 10 ; i++) (i is integer, so 0 i less than ten that is a true, i++ so  0+1 is 1 and again check a + and add more)
do while same as while but at least once
for when you want to use a discrete number of times
ls list of files
ctr l celar allc
return ((bill + ((((bill + ((bill * tax)/100))) * tip)) / 100) / 2 );
% numbers - int i, long li, float f, double f
% text - char c, string s
boolean - yes or no

1) preprocessing - thats a part with #, its a library pre process, contain functions,
2) compiling - compile code like i write
3) assembling - wierd language that is compiler is compile your code into and then into machine code that computer understand
4) linking - so every code like cs 50 vs code standard code are creating a together

so 1 is for library its like a book with functions, 2 compile code that i wrote, 3 change into assemble code, 4 connect all together
1 library > 2 into weird code > 3 machine code/binary code > 4 connect them together

what is intresting that counting start from 0

debug50 ./ and name - to debug

So about a bytes:
bool 1 byte
int 4 bytes
long 8 bytes
float 4 bytes
double 8 bytes
char 1 byte
string ? bytes
int indicate main and main mean 0, is hidden.
